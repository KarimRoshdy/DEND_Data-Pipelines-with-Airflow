# Summary of the Project
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.It is expected to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. It is also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and therefore it is required to run tests against the datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.


# Tasks
* Configuration of the DAG and update task dependencies. The DAG should look like as in the image.

![image info](./example-dag.png)

* Building the operators that will automate the process of staging the data, transforming the data, and run checks on data quality.
1. The stage operator is expected to be able to load any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters should specify where in S3 the file is loaded and what is the target table.
2. With dimension and fact operators, you can utilize the provided SQL helper class to run data transformations. Most of the logic is within the SQL transformations and the operator is expected to take as input a SQL statement and target database on which to run the query against.
3. The final operator to create is the data quality operator, which is used to run checks on the data itself. For example one test could be a SQL statement that checks if certain column contains NULL values by counting all the rows that have NULL in the column.

# Input data
All data resides in Amazon S3 bucket in two folders (song-data and log-data).

1. Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.

2. Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

# Output data
Using the song and log datasets, we create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

1. Fact Table
songplays
- Records: songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent.
- Primary Key: songplay_id.
- Foreign Keys: start_time, user_id, song_id, artist_id.

2. Dimension Tables
users
* Records: first_name, last_name, gender, level.
* Primary key: user_id.

songs
* Records: title, artist_id, year, duration.
* Primary key: song_id.

artists
* Records: artist_name, artist_location, artist_latitude, artist_longitude.
* Primary key: artist_id.

time
* Records: hour, day, week, month, year, weekday.
* Primary key: start_time. 

In addition two staging tables (Stage_events & Stage_songs) are created in the middel to hold the data in Redshift before distributing it to fact and dimension tables 

# Data Explanation
* The dag template has all the imports and task templates in place, but the task dependencies have not been set
* The operators folder with operator templates
* A helper class for the SQL transformations
* README.md: provides discussion on the process and decisions.

# How to run:
1. Make sure that all AWS and Redshift connections are set-up.
2. Run the dag on airflow UI
